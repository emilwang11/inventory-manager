# Menu Manager
## Shopify Fall 2021 Developer Intern Challenge

With the prompt of building an image repository in mind, I decided to turn it into a menu where users can buy and manage products.

To run the application, run `python run.py`

#### Home Page
As a customer,you are able to view the menu item's information and purchase it.

#### Manage Page
As an admin, you can:
1. Can edit the information (name, description, price and stock) about the items
2. Can delete products
3. Can view the amount of sales that have been made so far

## Next Steps
1. I chose to use SQLite initially because of how lightweight it is, however this presented some limitations later on with database interactions. If I had more time, I would use SQLAlchemy since it has an ORM.
2. Implement image upload feature so admins can change the image for the product as well as add new products
