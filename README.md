To run the application, run <pre><code> python run.py </code></pre>

#### Home Page
As a customer,you are able to view the menu item's information and purchase it.

##### Manage Page
As an admin, you can:
1. Can edit the information (name, description, price and stock) about the items
2. Can delete products
3. Can view the amount of sales that have been made so far

## Next Steps
1. I chose to use SQLite initially because of how lightweight it is, however this presented some limitations later on with database interactions. If I had more time, I would use SQLAlchemy since it has an ORM.
2. Implement image upload feature so admins can change the image for the product as well as add new products
